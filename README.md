# GENOME_BIOLOGY

All scripts and data necessary to reproduce the analyses in Cascarina and Ross (2019) *Genome Biology* (\*Link to paper when published) are provided in the sub-directories of this repository, along with specific README instructions for each set of analyses.

All analyses require the modified Prion Aggregation Prediction Algorithm (mPAPA.py) in the main GENOME_BIOLOGY repository. In addition, most scripts rely on multiple external Python packages. For simplicity, it is recommended that you first download and install the appropriate Anaconda distribution at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/, which automatically includes all necessary dependencies.


#### License info
mPAPA and all scripts provided in the GENOME_BIOLOGY repository are subject to the terms of the GPLv3 license according to license terms of the original PAPA algorithm.
